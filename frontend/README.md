# Resume Matcher Frontend

Welcome to the Resume Matcher Frontend! This project is built using Next.JS and leverages the Mistral AI API to help users determine how well their resume matches a job listing. It also provides a summary of the reasoning behind the match. The frontend is a simple web application that allows users to upload their resumes, add listings, and view the match analysis.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, set up the environment variables:

```bash
cp .env.example .env.production
```

Update the `.env.production` file with the appropriate values.

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
